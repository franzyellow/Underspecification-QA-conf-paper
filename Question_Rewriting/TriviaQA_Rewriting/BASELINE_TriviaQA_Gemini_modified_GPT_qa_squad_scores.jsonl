While the query specifies 'Japan,' it does not clarify which interpretation of 'hibachi' is being referenced. Without further context, the ambiguity leaves room for multiple plausible answers, making the query underspecified.","original_f1":0.1428571429,"original_em":0,"original_AA":0.75,"model_new_answer":["The hibachi is used for heating and sometimes for cooking."],"new_em":0,"new_f1":0.1}

'Come quietly' implies a potential confrontation or negotiation, while 'use earplugs' introduces a physical element suggesting possible escalation. However, critical contextual clues are missing: the identity of the speaker\/listener, the nature of the interaction (e.g., real-world scenario, fictional dialogue), and the underlying issue being addressed. The phrasing also hints at a power dynamic or threat, but without explicit clarification, the request remains vague and open to multiple interpretations.","original_f1":0.0,"original_em":0,"original_AA":0.0,"model_new_answer":["Spike Milligan"],"new_em":0,"new_f1":0.2666666667}

While Macbeth is a historical figure who became King of Scotland, he did not originate from an established royal dynasty. Historically, he was a thane who rose to power through regicide and lacked direct ties to a hereditary royal house. Additionally, the query does not specify whether it refers to the literary character from Shakespeare's 'Macbeth' or the historical figure. For the play, the narrative often associates Macbeth with the House of Banquo (as per the witches' prophecy), but this is fictional. Without clarification on context (historical vs. literary) or explicit reference to a specific dynasty, the query remains ambiguous.","original_f1":0.6666666667,"original_em":0,"original_AA":0.0,"model_new_answer":["House of Dunkeld"],"new_em":0,"new_f1":0.4}

While 'Winchester bushel' may reference a historical dry measure (e.g., 8 imperial gallons), this term is ambiguous without clarification. The query lacks specificity regarding whether 'Winchester' refers to a unit of volume, a container size, or a typographical error (e.g., 'bushel'). Additionally, conversions depend on whether the context uses imperial or US customary units, further complicating the answer.","original_f1":0.0,"original_em":0,"original_AA":0.0,"model_new_answer":["Channel 1"],"new_em":0,"new_f1":0.125}

However, these two books are authored by different writers (John le Carr\u00e9 and Ian McEwan respectively) and are sequels to distinct novels ('The Cider House Rules' and 'Atonement').

While it provides sufficient context (sport, competition, timeline), it lacks critical specificity: 'the end of which year?' Without a defined timeframe (e.g., 2023, 2024), the query remains ambiguous. Additionally, no prior knowledge of recent announcements is assumed, making the query reliant on external data not included in the prompt.
